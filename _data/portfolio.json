For the printing process, the company had several industrial printers, capable of print hundred of meters of paper per hour. These printers could only use a limited number of colours at the same same (oldest printers could only print using 1 colour, the newest were able to use up to 4) and if the colours used where changed (for example, after printing paper for red bags it was necessary to print paper for green bags), the printer would need to be stopped for clean it.For the manufacturing process, the company had several bag making machines, capable of make thousand of bag per hour. Depending of their model, each of these machines was capable to make different sizes of bags (some machines made small bags, others made medium and big bags) and if the dimension of the bag was changed (for example, after making bags of 20x10x10 if was necessary to make bags of 20x15x12), the machine would need to be stopped in order to re-configure it and change some of their parts.</p><p>These conditions made the organization of the production very complex, since the work orders needed to be organized in order to minimize the number of times that the printers and the bad making machines were stopped, avoid filling the deposit (with printed paper in the wait for being used) and respecting delivery deadlines.Since their ERP could not automatically organize the production taking in account all these variables, this task was being done manually although it was very time consuming and difficult to optimize.</p><h3>The solution</h3><p>A web application was implemented with the following features:</p><ul><li>Sellers can submit a sell order and get an estimated delivery date.</li><li>Every time that a sell order is submitted, a work order is created and scheduled into a printer and into a bag making machine, using an algorithm that optimizes the production while keeping the delivery dates inferior to three weeks.</li><li>Production managers can verify the work orders, modify manually the schedule of printers and bag making machines and export the work orders into the ERP used by the company.</li></ul><h3>The result</h3><p>The production was improved in a 15% and the number of man-hours required for organize the production was reduce by 80%.</p>',
